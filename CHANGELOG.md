# CHANGELOG

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- A tab load that failed mid-fetch left the previous resource type's rows in the
  table cache, reachable through search and pagination and wired to the new
  tab's delete handler — Delete could act on the wrong resource.
- Editing a datastore replaced its whole connection-parameter map, discarding
  pool settings, `Loose bbox`, `preparedStatements` and the real namespace,
  resetting a PMTiles store's range-reader provider to `file`, and re-enabling
  disabled stores. Edits now merge onto what the server holds.
- "Add a New Workspace/Datastore" silently overwrote an existing resource of the
  same name and reported it as created; both now refuse a taken name.
- A datastore cannot be renamed from the edit form any more: it would either
  duplicate the store or overwrite whatever already held the new name.
- Delete confirmations now state what the cascade takes with it (both delete
  paths send `recurse=true`).
- The first, blocking connection attempt no longer runs before the window is on
  screen, which made an unreachable host look like a hung QGIS.

- Bulk delete acted on the wrong rows once a column was sorted; table sorting is
  now disabled, since rows are paginated client-side.
- A wrong password or an HTTP error was reported as "server unreachable", and a
  404 from the configured URL was reported as a successful connection.
- Required form fields on an inactive tab were never validated, so datastores
  could be submitted without host, database, user or password.
- Editing a workspace from the datastore list repainted the table with the wrong
  resource type.
- A malformed GeoServer URL in the settings page silently discarded the
  credentials entered alongside it.
- Failures to write to the QGIS authentication database are now reported instead
  of leaving the plugin silently unconfigured.
- Editing a PostGIS datastore no longer sends GeoServer's encrypted password
  back as the new password; it has to be re-entered.

### Changed

- The bundled `geoservercloud` wheel is stripped of its acceptance-test
  fixtures: 16 MB -> 49 KB.
- The datastore list fetches store details in parallel (~5x faster) and caches
  workspace names between dialogs.
